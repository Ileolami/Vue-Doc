## Introduction

In addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (like `v-model` or `v-show`), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives.

Two forms of code reuse have been introduced in Vue: [components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html) and [composables](/reusability/composables). 
- Components are the main building blocks
- Composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. 

Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.

A custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component. The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to. Here is an example of a directive that adds a class to an element when it is inserted into the DOM by Vue:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Js">
<Code
lang="js"
code={`
const highlight = {
  mounted: (el) => el.classList.add('is-highlight')
}

export default {
  directives: {
    // enables v-highlight in template
    highlight
  }
}
`}
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Template">
<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<p v-highlight>This sentence is important!</p>
`}
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Preview" default>
  <div style="background-color: yellow; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">This sentence is important</div>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Similar to components, custom directives must be registered so that they can be used in templates. In the example above, we are using local registration via the `directives` option.

It is also common to globally register custom directives at the app level:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
app.directive('highlight', {
  mounted: (el) => el.classList.add('is-highlight')
})
`}
/>

## When to use custom directives​
Custom directives should only be used when the desired functionality can only be achieved via direct DOM manipulation.

A common example of this is a `v-focus` custom directive that brings an element into focus.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Vue">
<Code
lang="js"
code={`
const focus = {
  mounted: (el) => el.focus()
}

export default {
  directives: {
    // enables v-focus in template
    focus
  }
}
`}
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Template" default>
<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<input v-focus />
`}
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This directive is more useful than the `autofocus` attribute because it works not just on page load - it also works when the element is dynamically inserted by Vue!

Declarative templating with built-in directives such as `v-bind`  is recommended when possible because they are more efficient and server-rendering friendly.

---

## Directive Hooks​

A directive definition object can provide several hook functions (all optional):

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
const myDirective = {
  // called before bound element's attributes
  // or event listeners are applied
  created(el, binding, vnode) {
    // see below for details on arguments
  },
  // called right before the element is inserted into the DOM.
  beforeMount(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called when the bound element's parent component
  // and all its children are mounted.
  mounted(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is updated
  beforeUpdate(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called after the parent component and
  // all of its children have updated
  updated(el, binding, vnode, prevVnode) {},
  // called before the parent component is unmounted
  beforeUnmount(el, binding, vnode) {},
  // called when the parent component is unmounted
  unmounted(el, binding, vnode) {}
}
`}
/>

### Hook Arguments

- **el**: The element the directive is bound to. This can be used to directly manipulate the DOM.
- **binding**: An object containing the following properties:
  - **value**: The value passed to the directive. For example in `v-my-directive="1 + 1"`, the value would be `2`.
  - **oldValue**: The previous value, only available in `beforeUpdate` and `updated`. If the value is an object, it is the same object.
  - **arg**: The argument passed to the directive, if any. For example in `v-my-directive:foo`, the arg would be `"foo"`.
  - **modifiers**: An object containing modifiers, if any. For example in `v-my-directive.foo.bar`, the modifiers object would be `{ foo: true, bar: true }`.
  - **instance**: The instance of the component where the directive is used.
  - **dir**: The directive definition object itself.
- **vnode**: The underlying VNode for the directive's host element.
- **prevVnode**: The previous VNode, only available in `beforeUpdate` and `updated`.

As an example, consider the following directive usage:

<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<div v-example:foo.bar="baz">
</div>
`}
/>

The binding argument would be an object in the shape of:

```js
  arg: 'foo',
  modifiers: { bar: true },
  value: /* value of `baz` */,
  oldValue: /* value of `baz` on previous update */,
```

Similar to built-in directives, custom directive arguments can be dynamic. For example:
<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<div v-example:[arg]="value"></div>
`}
/>

Here the directive argument will be reactively updated based on `arg` property in our component state.

<Aside type="note">
Apart from `el`, you should treat these arguments as read-only and never modify them. If you need to share information across hooks, it is recommended to do so through element's [dataset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset).
</Aside>

## Function Shorthand​
It's common for a custom directive to have the same behavior for `mounted` and `updated`, with no need for the other hooks. In such cases we can define the directive as a function:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JS">
```js
app.directive('color', (el, binding) => {
  // this will be called for both `mounted` and `updated`
  el.style.color = binding.value
})
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Template" default>
<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<div v-color="color"></div>
`}
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Object Literals
If your directive needs multiple values, you can also pass in a JavaScript object literal. Remember, directives can take any valid JavaScript expression.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Template">
<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<div v-demo="{ color: 'white', text: 'hello!' }"></div>
`}
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JS" default>
<Code
lang="js"
code={`
app.directive('demo', (el, binding) => {
  console.log(binding.value.color) // => "white"
  console.log(binding.value.text) // => "hello!"
})
`}
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage on Components
<Aside type="caution" title="Not Recommended">
Using custom directives on components is not recommended. Unexpected behaviour may occur when a component has multiple root nodes.
</Aside>

When used on components, custom directives will always apply to a component's root node, similar to [Fallthrough Attributes](/components/fallthrough).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Component">
<Code
lang="js"
code={`
<MyComponent v-demo="test" />
`}
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Template" default>
<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<!-- template of MyComponent -->

<div> <!-- v-demo directive will be applied here -->
  <span>My component content</span>
</div>
`}
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You will notice that components can potentially have more than one root node. When applied to a multi-root component, a directive will be ignored and a warning will be thrown. Unlike attributes, directives can't be passed to a different element with `v-bind="$attrs"`.
