## Overview

Vue is designed to be performant for most common use cases without much need for manual optimizations. However, there are always challenging scenarios where extra fine-tuning is needed. In this section, we will discuss what you should pay attention to when it comes to performance in a Vue application.

First, let's discuss the two major aspects of web performance:

- **Page Load Performance**: how fast the application shows content and becomes interactive on the initial visit. This is usually measured using web vital metrics like [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/) and [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/articles/inp).

- **Update Performance**: how fast the application updates in response to user input. For example, how fast a list updates when the user types in a search box, or how fast the page switches when the user clicks a navigation link in a Single-Page Application (SPA).

While it would be ideal to maximize both, different frontend architectures tend to affect how easy it is to attain desired performance in these aspects. In addition, the type of application you are building greatly influences what you should prioritize in terms of performance. Therefore, the first step of ensuring optimal performance is picking the right architecture for the type of application you are building:

- Consult [Ways of Using Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue.html) to see how you can leverage Vue in different ways.

## Profiling Options​
To improve performance, we need to first know how to measure it. There are a number of great tools that can help in this regard:

For profiling load performance of production deployments:

- [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

For profiling performance during local development:

- [Chrome DevTools Performance Panel]9https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/
   - [`app.config.performance`](https://vuejs.org/api/application.html#app-config-performance) enables Vue-specific performance markers in Chrome DevTools' performance timeline.
- [Vue DevTools Extension](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#browser-devtools) also provides a performance profiling feature.

## Page Load Optimizations​
There are many framework-agnostic aspects for optimizing page load performance - check out this [web.dev guide](https://web.dev/fast/) for a comprehensive round up. Here, we will primarily focus on techniques that are specific to Vue.

### Choosing the Right Architecture​
If your use case is sensitive to page load performance, avoid shipping it as a pure client-side SPA. You want your server to be directly sending HTML containing the content the users want to see. Pure client-side rendering suffers from slow time-to-content. This can be mitigated with [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue.html#fullstack-ssr) or [Static Site Generation (SSG)](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/ways-of-using-vue.html#jamstack-ssg). Check out the [SSR Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/ssr.html) to learn about performing SSR with Vue. If your app doesn't have rich interactivity requirements, you can also use a traditional backend server to render the HTML and enhance it with Vue on the client.

If your main application has to be an SPA, but has marketing pages (landing, about, blog), ship them separately! Your marketing pages should ideally be deployed as static HTML with minimal JS, by using SSG.

### Bundle Size and Tree-shaking​
One of the most effective ways to improve page load performance is shipping smaller JavaScript bundles. Here are a few ways to reduce bundle size when using Vue:

- Use a build step if possible.

   - Many of Vue's APIs are ["tree-shakable"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking) if bundled via a modern build tool. For example, if you don't use the built-in `<Transition>` component, it won't be included in the final production bundle. Tree-shaking can also remove other unused modules in your source code.

   - When using a build step, templates are pre-compiled so we don't need to ship the Vue compiler to the browser. This saves 14kb min+gzipped JavaScript and avoids the runtime compilation cost.

- Be cautious of size when introducing new dependencies! In real-world applications, bloated bundles are most often a result of introducing heavy dependencies without realizing it.

    - If using a build step, prefer dependencies that offer ES module formats and are tree-shaking friendly. For example, prefer `lodash-es` over `lodash`.

    - Check a dependency's size and evaluate whether it is worth the functionality it provides. Note if the dependency is tree-shaking friendly, the actual size increase will depend on the APIs you actually import from it. Tools like [bundlejs.com](https://bundlejs.com/) can be used for quick checks, but measuring with your actual build setup will always be the most accurate.

- If you are using Vue primarily for progressive enhancement and prefer to avoid a build step, consider using [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) (only 6kb) instead.

## Code Splitting​
Code splitting is where a build tool splits the application bundle into multiple smaller chunks, which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. With proper code splitting, features required at page load can be downloaded immediately, with additional chunks being lazy loaded only when needed, thus improving performance.

Bundlers like Rollup (which Vite is based upon) or webpack can automatically create split chunks by detecting the ESM dynamic import syntax:

```js 
// lazy.js and its dependencies will be split into a separate chunk
// and only loaded when `loadLazy()` is called.
function loadLazy() {
  return import('./lazy.js')
}
```

Lazy loading is best used on features that are not immediately needed after initial page load. In Vue applications, this can be used in combination with Vue's [Async Component](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/async.html) feature to create split chunks for component trees:

```js
import { defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'

// a separate chunk is created for Foo.vue and its dependencies.
// it is only fetched on demand when the async component is
// rendered on the page.
const Foo = defineAsyncComponent(() => import('./Foo.vue'))
```

For applications using Vue Router, it is strongly recommended to use lazy loading for route components. Vue Router has explicit support for lazy loading, separate from `defineAsyncComponent`. See [Lazy Loading Routes](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html) for more details.

## Update Optimizations​

### Props Stability​

In Vue, a child component only updates when at least one of its received props has changed. Consider the following example:

```js
<ListItem
  v-for="item in list"
  :id="item.id"
  :active-id="activeId" />
```

Inside the `<ListItem>` component, it uses its `id` and `activeId` props to determine whether it is the currently active item. While this works, the problem is that whenever `activeId` changes, every `<ListItem>` in the list has to update!

Ideally, only the items whose active status changed should update. We can achieve that by moving the active status computation into the parent, and make `<ListItem>` directly accept an `active` prop instead:

```js
<ListItem
  v-for="item in list"
  :id="item.id"
  :active="item.id === activeId" />
```

`v-once​`
`v-once` is a built-in directive that can be used to render content that relies on runtime data but never needs to update. The entire sub-tree it is used on will be skipped for all future updates. 

Consult its [API reference](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-once) for more details.

`v-memo​`
`v-memo` is a built-in directive that can be used to conditionally skip the update of large sub-trees or `v-for` lists. 

Consult its [API reference](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-memo) for more details.

### Computed Stability​
In Vue 3.4 and above, a computed property will only trigger effects when its computed value has changed from the previous one. For example, the following `isEven` computed only triggers effects if the returned value has changed from `true` to `false`, or vice-versa:

```js
const count = ref(0)
const isEven = computed(() => count.value % 2 === 0)

watchEffect(() => console.log(isEven.value)) // true

// will not trigger new logs because the computed value stays `true`
count.value = 2
count.value = 4
```

This reduces unnecessary effect triggers, but unfortunately doesn't work if the computed creates a new object on each compute:

```js
const computedObj = computed(() => {
  return {
    isEven: count.value % 2 === 0
  }
})
```

Because a new object is created each time, the new value is technically always different from the old value. Even if the `isEven` property remains the same, Vue won't be able to know unless it performs a deep comparison of the old value and the new value. Such comparison could be expensive and likely not worth it.

Instead, we can optimize this by manually comparing the new value with the old value, and conditionally returning the old value if we know nothing has changed:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Code">
```js
const computedObj = computed((oldValue) => {
  const newValue = {
    isEven: count.value % 2 === 0
  }
  if (oldValue && oldValue.isEven === newValue.isEven) {
    return oldValue
  }
  return newValue
})
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Preview" default>
<div class="preview"><Opt client:load /></div>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
You should always perform the full computation before comparing and returning the old value, so that the same dependencies can be collected on every run.
