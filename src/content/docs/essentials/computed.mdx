## Basic Examples

In-template expressions are very convenient, but they are meant for simple operations. Putting too much logic in your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain. For example, if you have an object with a nested array:
<Code
lang="js"
code={`
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})`}
/>

And you want to display different messages depending on if author already has some books or not:

<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<p>Has published books:</p>
<span>{{ author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}</span>
`}
/>

At this point, the template is getting a bit cluttered. You have to look at it for a second before realizing that it performs a calculation depending on `author.books`. More importantly, you probably don't want to repeat yourself if you need to include this calculation in the template more than once.

That's why for complex logic that includes reactive data, it is recommended to use a **computed property**. 

Here's the same example, refactored:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="vue">
 <Code
lang="vue"
code={`
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  computed: {
    // a computed getter
    publishedBooksMessage() {
        // this refers to the component instance
      return this.author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
    }
  }
}
`}
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="html">
<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<p>Has published books:</p>
<span>{{ publishedBooksMessage }}</span>
`}
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Preview">
 **Has published books: Yes**
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here you have declared a computed property `publishedBooksMessage`.

Try to change the value of the books array in the application data and you will see how `publishedBooksMessage` is changing accordingly.

You can data-bind to computed properties in templates just like a normal property. Vue is aware that `this.publishedBooksMessage` depends on `this.author.books`, so it will update any bindings that depend on `this.publishedBooksMessage` when `this.author.books` changes.

## Computed Caching vs. Methods​

You may have noticed you can achieve the same result by invoking a method in the expression:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="HTML">
<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<p>{{ calculateBooksMessage() }}</p>
`}
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Vue">
<Code 
lang="js"
code={` // in component
methods: {
  calculateBooksMessage() {
    return this.author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
  }
}`}
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Instead of a computed property, you can define the same function as a method. 
For the end result, the two approaches are indeed exactly the same. 

However, the difference is that **computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies**. 
A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its reactive dependencies have changed. 
This means as long as `author.books` has not changed, multiple access to `publishedBooksMessage` will immediately return the previously computed result without having to run the getter function again.

This also means the following computed property will never update, because `Date.now()` is not a reactive dependency:
<Code
lang="js"
code={`
computed: {
  now() {
    return Date.now()
  }
}
`}
/>

In comparison, a method invocation will always run the function whenever a re-render happens.

### Why do you need caching?

Imagine you have an expensive computed property `list`, which requires looping through a huge array and doing a lot of computations. Then you may have other computed properties that in turn depend on `list`. Without caching, you would be executing `list`’s getter many more times than necessary! In cases where you do not want caching, use a method call instead.

## Writable Computed​
**Computed properties are by default getter-only**. If you attempt to assign a new value to a computed property, you will receive a runtime warning. 
In the rare cases where you need a "**writable**" computed property, you can create one by providing both a getter and a setter:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe'
    }
  },
  computed: {
    fullName: {
      // getter
      get() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
      },
      // setter
      set(newValue) {
        // Note: we are using destructuring assignment syntax here.
        [this.firstName, this.lastName] = newValue.split(' ')
      }
    }
  }
}
`}
/>

Now when you run `this.fullName = 'John Doe'`, the setter will be invoked and `this.firstName` and `this.lastName` will be updated accordingly.

## Getting Previous Value

:::caution
Only supported in 3.4+
:::

In case you need it, you can get the previous value returned by the computed property accessing the first argument of the getter:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 2
    }
  },
  computed: {
    // This computed will return the value of count when it's less or equal to 3.
    // When count is >=4, the last value that fulfilled our condition will be returned
    // instead until count is less or equal to 3
    alwaysSmall(_, previous) {
      if (this.count <= 3) {
        return this.count
      }

      return previous
    }
  }
}
`}
/>

In case you're using a writable computed:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 2
    }
  },
  computed: {
    alwaysSmall: {
      get(previous) {
        if (this.count <= 3) {
          return this.count
        }

        return previous;
      },
      set(newValue) {
        this.count = newValue * 2
      }
    }
  }
}
`}
/>

## Best Practices​

### Getters should be side-effect free​

It is important to remember that computed getter functions should only perform pure computation and be free of side effects. For example, **don't mutate other state, make async requests, or mutate the DOM inside a computed getter!** Think of a computed property as declaratively describing how to derive a value based on other values - its only responsibility should be computing and returning that value. Later in the guide we will discuss how we can perform side effects in reaction to state changes with [watchers](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/watchers.html).

### Avoid mutating computed value​
The returned value from a computed property is derived state. Think of it as a temporary snapshot - every time the source state changes, a new snapshot is created. It does not make sense to mutate a snapshot, so a computed return value should be treated as read-only and never be mutated - instead, update the source state it depends on to trigger new computations.
