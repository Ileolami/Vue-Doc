## Declaring Reactive State​

With the Options API, `data` option are used to declare reactive state of a component. The option value should be a function that returns an object. Vue will call the function when creating a new component instance, and wrap the returned object in its reactivity system. Any top-level properties of this object are proxied on the component instance (`this` in methods and lifecycle hooks):

<Code
lang="js"
mark={[2,3,4,5,6]}
code={
`export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 1
    }
  },
    // mounted is a lifecycle hook which we will explain later
    mounted() {
      // this refers to the component instance.
      console.log(this.count) // => 1

      // data can be mutated as well
      this.count = 2
  }
}`}
/>

These instance properties are only added when the instance is first created, so you need to ensure they are all present in the object returned by the `data` function. Where necessary, use `null`, `undefined` or some other placeholder value for properties where the desired value isn't yet available.

It is possible to add a new property directly to `this` without including it in `data`. However, properties added this way will not be able to trigger reactive updates.

Vue uses a `$` prefix when exposing its own built-in APIs via the component instance. It also reserves the prefix `_` for internal properties. You should avoid using names for top-level `data` properties that start with either of these characters.

### Reactive Proxy vs. Original​
<Aside type="note" title="Vue 2 users">
In Vue 3, data is made reactive by leveraging [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy).
</Aside>

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
    export default {
  data() {
    return {
      someObject: {}
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    const newObject = {}
    this.someObject = newObject

    console.log(newObject === this.someObject) // false
  }
`}
/>

When you access `this.someObject` after assigning it, the value is a reactive proxy of the original `newObject`. Unlike in Vue 2, the original `newObject` is left intact and will not be made reactive: make sure to always access reactive state as a property of `this`.

## Declaring Methods

  Methods in Vue 3
</LinkButton>

`methods` option are used to declare methods on a component instance. This should be an object containing the desired methods:

<Code
lang="js"
mark={[7,8,9,10,11]}
code={`
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // methods can be called in lifecycle hooks, or other methods!
    this.increment()
  }
}`}
/>

Vue automatically binds the `this` value for `methods` so that it always refers to the component instance. 
This ensures that a method retains the correct `this` value if it's used as an event listener or callback. 
You should avoid using arrow functions when defining `methods`, as that prevents Vue from binding the appropriate `this` value:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
export default {
  methods: {
    increment: () => {
      // BAD: no this access here!
    }
  }
}`}
/>

Just like all other properties of the component instance, the `methods` are accessible from within the component's template. They are commonly used as event listeners inside templates:

<Code
lang="html"
code={`
<button @click="increment">
  {{ count }}
</button>
`}
/>

In the example above, the method `increment` will be called when the `<button>` is clicked.

### Deep Reactivity​
In Vue, state is deeply reactive by default. This means you can expect changes to be detected even when you mutate nested objects or arrays:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      obj: {
        nested: { count: 0 },
        arr: ['foo', 'bar']
      }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    mutateDeeply() {
      // these will work as expected.
      this.obj.nested.count++
      this.obj.arr.push('baz')
    }
  }
}`}
/>

### DOM Update Timing​
When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically. However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you can use the [nextTick()](https://vuejs.org/api/general.html#nexttick) global API:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
import { nextTick } from 'vue'

export default {
  methods: {
    async increment() {
      this.count++
      await nextTick()
      // Now the DOM is updated
    }
  }
}`}
/>

### Stateful Methods​
In some cases, you may need to dynamically create a method function, for example creating a debounced event handler:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'

export default {
  methods: {
    // Debouncing with Lodash
    click: debounce(function () {
      // ... respond to click ...
    }, 500)
  }
}`}
/>

However, this approach is problematic for components that are reused because a debounced function is stateful: it maintains some internal state on the elapsed time. If multiple component instances share the same debounced function, they will interfere with one another.

To keep each component instance's debounced function independent of the others, we can create the debounced version in the `created` lifecycle hook:

<Code
lang="js"
code={`
export default {
  created() {
    // each instance now has its own copy of debounced handler
    this.debouncedClick = _.debounce(this.click, 500)
  },
  unmounted() {
    // also a good idea to cancel the timer
    // when the component is removed
    this.debouncedClick.cancel()
  },
  methods: {
    click() {
      // ... respond to click ...
    }
  }
}`}
/>
